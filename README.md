📊 Data Exploration & Preprocessing – Data Science Internship Project

📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**, where I focused on preparing real-world datasets for analysis. The goal was to understand the structure of the data, clean it, and ensure it was ready for further processing and model building.

📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes:
- Restaurant ratings and related features
- Customer feedback and cuisine information
- "Aggregate rating" as the target variable

🛠️ Tech Stack  
Programming Language: Python  
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

🔍 Workflow  
✅ Dataset Overview: Loaded the dataset and examined its structure (rows, columns, datatypes).  
✅ Missing Values: Identified missing data and handled it using appropriate techniques (drop, fill, impute).  
✅ Data Type Conversion: Ensured correct data types for numeric and categorical fields.  
✅ Target Analysis: Explored the distribution of **"Aggregate rating"** and checked for class imbalance.  
✅ Visualization: Created charts and graphs to support insights and improve interpretability.

📈 Results  
- Cleaned and structured dataset ready for modeling.  
- Detected and resolved missing values and inconsistencies.  
- Gained insights into the distribution and balance of the target variable.

🚀 Key Learnings  
- Importance of thorough data cleaning before analysis  
- Practical experience with missing data handling  
- Better understanding of rating distributions and their impact on model fairness  

🌟 Acknowledgment  
This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**, where I am gaining real-world experience in preparing and analyzing data.
